*** Applicability of Neuroevolution to Denial of Service Attack Detection ***

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a major cyber threat, denying legitimate
users access to services, costing organisations thousands in lost business, and
reducing the quality of networks globally. Neural networks have been shown to be
able to effectively detect DoS traffic, but suffer from two major shortcomings:
the network structure is presupposed by the operator, and there must be tagged
network traffic available.

In our research we aim to determine whether or not neuroevolutionary algorithms
such as NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) are suitable for the task
of DoS detection by comparing their performance to existing solutions.
Neuroevolution can potentially solve the issues faced by neural networks by
allowing the network structure to evolve in response to its performance, which
is determined via heuristics.
